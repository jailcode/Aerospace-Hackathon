    - Something that calcutes magnitude of angular acceleration..., 
    - Something to calculate Kp.., (kp is a constant multiplied by 1 over magnitude)
    - Parsing of values from gyroscope and accerelometer 
    - Function which gives difference in time.. (milisecond)
    - current time (in milisecond) - epoch time.. (basically difference between two inputs) (old time and new time)
    - And something to calculate error function..... (three parameter)
    - something to wait for signals from sensors
